Basic CAPTCHA Verification App

Brief Overview:
- This project is a simple CAPTCHA verification system built to generate and validate user inputs against a CAPTCHA code. It employs random text 
  generation, a dynamic canvas for displaying CAPTCHA, and JavaScript for interaction and validation.

Key Features:
- Dynamic CAPTCHA Generation: Random 6-character alphanumeric CAPTCHA created each time the app reloads or 
  the user refreshes.
- Canvas Rendering: CAPTCHA displayed on an HTML canvas with added noise, rotations, and distortions to 
  enhance security.
- Input Validation: User input is verified, and appropriate feedback is provided (correct, incomplete, or 
  incorrect).
- Interactive Features: Includes a "Reload CAPTCHA" button to regenerate the CAPTCHA and a "Check CAPTCHA" 
  button to validate input.
- Responsive Feedback: Displays feedback messages in real-time, including status reset after a few seconds.

Technologies Used:
- HTML: Structured the page, including input fields and buttons.
- CSS: Styled the layout and visual components.
- JavaScript: Handled CAPTCHA generation, canvas drawing, input validation, and feedback mechanisms.

My Role:
- Designed and developed the entire project independently, focusing on integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive CAPTCHA 
  system.

Challenges Solved:
- Learning to use the HTML canvas for rendering text and adding distortions and noise.
- Implementing real-time feedback for user input validation.
- Ensuring dynamic CAPTCHA updates with seamless user experience.

Outcome:
- The project successfully demonstrated how to build a functional CAPTCHA system using JavaScript. It served as a great learning experience for 
  working with the canvas API, dynamic input validation, and interactive web applications.
